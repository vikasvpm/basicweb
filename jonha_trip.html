	The above is a photo of me exploring Jonha waterfall, which is located in my hometown of Ranchi and it is over the Gautamdhara river. I had a lot of fun during this recent trip of mine as I love waterfalls and I therefore consider myself lucky to be born and brought up in Ranchi as it is home to a lot of waterfalls few of them are mentioned below:-
